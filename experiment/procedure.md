### Procedure

#### a) Circuit formulation:<br>
1. Connect the circuit to form a 3-phase uncontrolled full-bridge rectifier.<br>
2. Click on “CHECK” button to verify the circuit.<br>
3. a). If all connections are correct then click on “NEXT” button and proceed for experimentation.<br>
b). If connections are wrong. Press the “RESET” button and reconnect the terminals to create correct circuit.<br>

#### b) Operating the circuit:<br>
1. Operate the circuit by clicking “NEXT MODE” and see the waveforms.<br>

#### c) Performance analysis of the circuit:<br>
1. Select the load out of the options given.<br>
2. Change the source voltage and click on “RECORD” button to fill the table.<br>
3. Click on respective “ICONS” to see the various plots for performance analysis.<br>
